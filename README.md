# FictionBot IV 
This is the 4.0 Version of Fiction Bot, a pure Python-based internet novel downloader, more concise and readable code, 3x faster than previous versions. 

## What's New?
- Featuring **AutoPublish\***
- The code is 4 times shorter, but 3 times faster!
- Chapter tracking feature is removed, because we are focusing on whole-book downloading and publishing.

## AutoPublish
**txt** files are good, but not good enough for reading. This script is able to create a minimal **ePub** package where all chapters 
are properly indexed which enables the **TOC** feature across all reading devices! ~(Except Kindle, you have to convert it to MOBI format first)~

## Kindle ebook Workflow: Download, Pack, Convert, Send!
We do the previous two steps for you only :)
